## üì° Voice-to-Voice Workflow

Below is how **audio chunks** flow from microphone to AI response:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ User Speaks
- Microphone captures **raw PCM audio** via browser's Web Audio API.
- Audio is split into **small chunks** (e.g., 20‚Äì50ms each).

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Chunks Sent to Backend
- Each chunk is **streamed** to the FastAPI backend over **WebSocket**.
- Chunks are added to an **audio buffer**.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Transcription
- The backend passes buffered chunks to **OpenAI Whisper** (or similar) in **real time**.
- Transcribed text is sent to the chatbot engine.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ AI Response
- **LangChain** queries:
  1. The scraped company data (stored in **Pinecone**).
  2. The **LLM** (OpenAI GPT).
- The chatbot generates a **text response**.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Voice Synthesis
- The text is sent to **Text-to-Speech** (TTS) API.
- TTS returns **PCM chunks** of speech audio.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Smooth Playback
- PCM chunks are buffered and scheduled **one after another** using the **AudioContext** API.
- Playback is **gapless** because each chunk is timestamped and queued in sequence.

## üîç Why PCM and Not MP3 for Streaming?
- **PCM (Pulse Code Modulation)** is raw, uncompressed audio.
- It avoids decoding delays, allowing **low-latency streaming**.
- MP3 is compressed and requires **full decoding before playback**, introducing lag.
